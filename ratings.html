      <h3>Purpose:</h3>
      <p>Id rate my purpose at a 3 it works just a very minimal design but right away you cant tell it has something to with suits and its a shop with the first link being shop.
      <h3>Font:</h3>
      <p> Pretty happy with my fonts and font sizes, i would give it a 4 I was going for a classy and elegant font scheme which I think I accopmplished.</p>
      <h3>Colors:</h3>
      <p>Again keeping with the classy an elegant theme I stuck with black, white and a light grey which I think portrays sophisticated and expensive I would give a 3.</p>
      <h3>Layout:</h3>
      <p>The layout is farily easy to naviagate home page includes important links with a submenu taking you to other pages, but with the full width banners and then leading into easy access for social media would give a 4.</p>
      <h3>Complextity:</h3>
      <p>I dont think its too complex esspecially when you get to the shop page you just choose your suit and can customize to your liking or just add to cart, even though i still need to build out the cart, and checkout page for the user to complete the order</p>
